  For our project 3 we estimate that the project will take about 1.82 weeks and roughly 50 hours total. We came to that conclusion by using the LOC method. First we figured out the number of lines (1,045) of code in previous projects, then got a rough estimate of how many we would produce in project 3. We divided the amount of lines by 115, the total number of hours my group thought they would take to finish their part of the project, and got 9.09. We then divided that by 5, the number of group members, and arrived at the conclusion of 1.82 weeks. We said the project as a whole would take 50 hours because we werenâ€™t working on a full project since this is only a demo, so 50 hours sounded right for the estimate.
